## Overview
"Hanglanta" was created by using basic skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The objective of this project was to create a game that shows manipulation of the DOM. I chose Hangman, which displays a randomized set of words related to my hometown, Atlanta! 

## How To Play
1. Press start to display a random word.
2. Select and click letter to guess. 
3. If letter is correct, it will turn green and display in the random word.
4. If letter is incorrect, it will turn red and you will lose a life.
5. After losing 6 lives, you lose the game.
6. If you guess all of the letters correctly, you win.
7. Press start to replay.
